Cet matin premier OpenCoffee Club pour allostudio. Il s'agit d'une réunion hebdomadaire et informelle d'entrepreneurs. Je vous copie leur who why what disponible sur la <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2394379254">page Facebook du groupe</a>.
<blockquote>Who's invited?
Anyone. This is not about meeting someone in particular, hopefully it's about giving people focussed times and places where they can hang out and connect with others -- not locked inside an office or at a private members club.

Why?
Well, one of the things we've heard repeatedly over the time is: investors are inaccessible, entrepreneurs need regular physical space to meet, not just each other but also also network with investors and corporates. We all get an enormous amount from informal contact.

What can you do?
If you're an investor or entrepreneur, come by, talk about and promote our OpenCoffee Club Paris.</blockquote>
