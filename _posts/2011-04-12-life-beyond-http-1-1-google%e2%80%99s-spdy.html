<blockquote>Google's servers are also SPDY enabled. In other words, if you use Chrome, and you're using Google services, then many of those pages are not arriving to you over HTTP - <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spdy-dev/msg/dcc9c3a3e50c694f">you are actually running over SPDY</a>!</blockquote>
