Railscasts has always been my favourite Rails ressource. I use it since I started learning Rails four years ago and I just love the pedagogy and the choice of subjects. I'm now a pro member, and I just wanted to say thank you. If you don't know Railscasts, check it here: <a href="http://railscasts.com/">http://railscasts.com/</a>
