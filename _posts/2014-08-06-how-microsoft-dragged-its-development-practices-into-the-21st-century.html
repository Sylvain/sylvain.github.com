<blockquote>
The wretched waterfall

The waterfall process has always been regarded with suspicion. Even when first named and described in the 1970s, it was not regarded as an ideal process that organizations should aspire to. Rather, it was a description of a process that organizations used but which had a number of flaws that made it unsuitable to most development tasks.

It has, however, persisted. It's still being commonly used today because it has a kind of intuitive appeal.

For example, lots of companies develop in-house applications to automate various business processes. In the course of developing these applications, it's often discovered that the old process just isn't that great. Developers will discover that there are redundant steps, or that two processes should be merged into one, or that one should be split into two. Electronic forms that mirror paper forms in their layout and sequence can provide familiarity, but it's often the case that rearranging the forms can be more logical. Processes that were thought to be understood and performed by the book can be found to work a little differently in practice.</blockquote>
